## What are the odds? by Charbel Berkachi


To be able to vizualize the page and run both baackend and frontend
1.Have docker desktop opened 
2.Open the developperTest in you command line
3.Type 'docker compose build'
4.Type 'docker compose up -d'
5.Go on 'http://localhost:8501/'
6.Upload empire.json file 
7.Stop the Empire to destroy the galaxy

Note: uploading the empire.json file might not display the right info because I could't finish this one part as I had health and time issues due to my full time current work

To be able to run the CLI
1.Open the backend in your command line
2.Install poetry (Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.)
3.Run 'python cli.py millennium-falcon.json empire.json'
4.You can change the inputs by just dragging another version of the file inside inputs
5-Save the GALAXY
